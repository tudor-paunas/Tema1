        <p>Autocompleting text with known values seems like an easy problem to solve, but so so so many UIs get it
          wrong. I see this frequently enough that, rather than complain about them individually, I though I’d just
          write down the set of rules they often break.</p>

        <p>There may be cases where some of these rules aren’t the best thing to do, but there should be a good reason
          for breaking one of these rules (for example, some of these rules don’t apply if a field must be filled with a
          value from a fixed set, like the list of US states). Following these rules should always result in at very
          least a sane experience:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Exact matches always come first. If the user types in an option exactly, other options must always go
            below the one matching what they typed.</li>
          <li>Besides exact matches, prefix matches come first. If I type “Fr” I want “Fresno” not “San Francisco.”</li>
          <li>After prefix matches, it can fall back to substring matches. Starting with substring matches would almost
            always be the wrong thing to do since users start typing words at the beginning not somewhere in the middle.
          </li>
          <li>If there are no substring matches, it can optionally fall back to subsequence matching. This is only
            useful in some cases.</li>
          <li>If there are no subsequence/substring matches, it can optionally fall back to approximate matches. This is
            rarely necessary to provide.</li>
          <li>Matches should be sorted alphabetically.</li>
          <li>When one option is the prefix of another, put the <em>shortest one first</em>.</li>
          <li>The matching should probably be case insensitive unless there are two options that differ only by case. In
            that case (pun intended), prefer the one that more closely matches the user’s input.</li>
          <li>The action to make use of the selection (e.g.&nbsp;to search the term) must be a different key than the
            action to accept the first suggestion <em>unless</em> you have to do something first to start using
            autocomplete suggestions (e.g.&nbsp;hit the down arrow). The user should never have to take extra steps to
            <em>not</em> use autocomplete.</li>
          <li>The tab key should always accept the current autocomplete option, if there is one (whether it is
            highlighted in a dropdown or suggested inline).</li>
          <li>If an autocomplete selection is highlighted, pressing enter should always make use of that selection. It
            should never revert to a default selection, even if part of the page is loading. If something is still
            loading, it is better to ignore the enter press than to navigate to the wrong destination.</li>
          <li>Autocomplete should almost never activate on keypresses when the field using autocomplete is not focused.
          </li>
          <li>The results should come in &lt;100ms in the common case.</li>
          <li>It’s OK to pause autocompleting when the user is rapidly typing additional letters, but don’t show results
            from the middle of that burst of letters after the user has finished typing. It’s better to wait longer and
            change the results once than to show results that appear finished but aren’t. (I admit that this rule is
            quite subjective.)</li>
          <li>If an option is highlighted, never change it, even if new data is loaded.</li>
        </ul>


        <p>There are some optional features that make sense in certain kinds of autocompletion and not others. I’m sure
          there are more correct names for these features than what I listed.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Show options I’ve used before when I focus the field but haven’t entered anything yet.</li>
          <li>Autocompletion to the nearest ambiguous prefix. If I type “g” and that matches both “Google” and
            “GoodReads”, this operation would fill in the two “o”s, allowing me to then type either “g” or “d” to select
            the option I want.</li>
          <li>Multipart matching. This is useful for autocompleting file paths, where I might enter “e/b/a” to
            autocomplete “env/bin/activate”. <code>ZSH</code> does this well.</li>
          <li>Recursive matching. Since autocompletion sometimes serves dual purpose as a quick way to browse options,
            sometimes you want to start with a broad filter and then search within those results. For example, if I
            enter “.pdf” to see all pdf files, I can then hit some key (perhaps comma) to start searching within those
            results, even though what I am now typing actually appears in the name <em>before</em> what I typed
            previously.</li>
          <li>Spelling correction. This tends to be useful in search engines.</li>
          <li>Aliases. When trying to autocomplete a username, the person’s first/last name could be allowed to
            autocomplete to their username. The same goes for state abbreviations suggesting the full state.</li>
          <li>Additional information in the results. If you are autocompleting function names, it is nice to see a list
            of the arguments they take.</li>
          <li>Context-aware suggestions. This is useful when autocompleting code or a word (usually on a mobile phone)
            where the context is very predictive of what the desired result is likely to be.</li>
          <li>Make it possible to go back to what I’ve typed after accepting an autocomplete suggestion. (The up arrow
            key tends to be a nice way to allow this.)</li>
        </ul>
